# üè® Overlook Hotel üè®

## Abstract

Overlook Hotel is a hotel management application that allows hotel customers to view their past and upcoming bookings, track the total cost of all bookings, and book a future reservation. This app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and local APIs. Users are only able to access their account information after logging in with their unique username and password.

## Preview of Application

## Installation Instructions
1. This website fetches data from an API, so you will need to clone down and run `git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/overlook-api.git`.
2. `CD` into that directory, run `npm install`, and then `npm start`. You should see "Overlook API is now running at http://localhost:3001/".
3. In a NEW terminal tab, `CD` to a directory outside of the API directory you cloned down to perform the subsequent steps. Do not close the terminal tab running the API.
3. In your new terminal tab, clone [this repo](https://github.com/jmyacobn/overlook) to your local computer.
4. `CD` into that directory, run `npm install`, and then `npm start`. You should see "Project is now running at http://localhost:8080/"
5. Copy and paste the link that appears in your terminal in your browser.
6. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server. Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.

## Context
Overlook Hotel was my final capstone project for Module 2 at Turing School of Software Development and Design after being a software developer for only 12 weeks. We were given a full week to complete this project while balancing classes, professional development, other assignments, and our final assessment. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html).
